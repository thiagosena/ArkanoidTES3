The objective of the game is to control a paddle to bounce a ball against blocks on top of the screen. Each block sum hit points the player, the player loses the ball reaches the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n<h3>Tests</h3>\r\nApp setup for unit testing client-side JavaScript code with [Jasmine.js](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)\r\n\r\nThis sample also includes a [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) configuration to run the tests automatically.\r\n\r\nTo use Karma, you need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed. In the project directory, type `npm install karma-mocha`. After the karma install is finished, type `node_modules/.bin/karma start` and navigate to `http://localhost:9876` to let Karma capture the web browser and run the tests automatically.\r\n\r\nIn this sample, we use the [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration testing and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) for works with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to find gaps in coverage.\r\n\r\n* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) is configured by adding a file named .travis.yml, which is a YAML format text file, to the root directory of the GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n* [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) works with your CI server and sifts through your coverage data to find gaps in coverage you didn't even know you had, before they become a problem.\r\n \r\n<h3>Important source files</h3>\r\n* [arkanoid.js](https://github.com/thiagosena/ArkanoidTES3/blob/master/js/arkanoid.js) - implementation javascript code for the game<br />\r\n* [audio.js](https://github.com/thiagosena/ArkanoidTES3/blob/master/js/audio.js) - implementation javascript code for the audio in the game<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>Important tests files</h3>\r\n* [ark-spec.js](https://github.com/thiagosena/ArkanoidTES3/blob/master/tests/ark-spec.js) - test implementation for the file arkanoid.js\r\n* [audio-spec.js](https://github.com/thiagosena/ArkanoidTES3/blob/master/tests/audio-spec.js) - test implementation for the file audio.js\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\r\n* [Arthur Macedo](https://github.com/arthurmz)\r\n* [Bledson Kivy](https://github.com/Bledson)\r\n* [Thiago Sena](https://github.com/thiagosena)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
